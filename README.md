### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Collins Kasyoki Thano, a software programmer. Sometimes I do call myself a Software Engineer.

- ðŸ”­ I am work with Python, JS, HTML, CSS and frameworks associated with them. [Django, FastAPI, Flask, React, Next.js]
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Data Analytics by going deep into Python and assocaited data science modules. I am quite intrigued by moving and manipulating data to simplify what happens behind the scenes.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate on anything Python or JS related and potentially moving on to embedded programming and IoT in the near future.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about APIs, Database design, and crazy ideas about Agriculture and IoT (NB: I am NOT a farmer).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [X](https://x.com/CollinsKasyoki), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/collins-thano), and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/collinskasyoki).
- âš¡ Fun fact: We need more efficient software, not necessarily more powerful machines. But then, Jevons Paradox.
