### Greetings ðŸ‘‹. My name is Collins Kasyoki Thano, and I am a software programmer. You can also call me a Software Engineer.

- ðŸ”­ I work with **Python, JS, HTML, CSS**, and their associated frameworks like **Django, FastAPI, Flask, React**, and **Next.js**.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am diving deeper into Python and *data science modules* to learn *Data Analytics*. I find it fascinating to manipulate and move data, simplifying what happens behind the scenes.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to **collaborate** on anything Python or JS related and potentially moving on to embedded programming and IoT in the near future.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about **APIs, database design**, or even share ideas about Agriculture and IoT (although I am not a farmer).
- ðŸ“«  You can reach me through [X](https://x.com/CollinsKasyoki), connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/collins-thano), or find me on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/collinskasyoki).

âš¡ Fun fact: I believe we need more efficient software, not necessarily more powerful machines. But then, there's something called Jevons Paradox.
